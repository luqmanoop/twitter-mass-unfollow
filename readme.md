#### Exclude users

Keep a whitelist of users (Twitter handles/usernames) to not be unfollowed. This could be people that you both are following each other or not. Twitter handles added here will always be given priority regardless of the action button clicked.

#### Stop after 1 minute

The extension will stop running (unfollowing users) after 1minute from time started. **If unchecked, it will run until there's no one to unfollow & you'd have to manually "STOP" the process as you see fit** See [NOTE](#note) below

#### Reload on finished

Whether the extension should reload the current page after the running process is finished/done. By default, page will be refreshed. You can uncheck this to manually reload the page yourself.

## NOTE

By default, the unfollow process runs for 1 minute (which can be turned off in the extension options page) and there's a delay between each unfollowing action. This is a safety measure to not violate [Twitter Rule](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit) which could lead to having your account restricted by Twitter.
